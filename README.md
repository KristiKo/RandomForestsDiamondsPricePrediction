# RandomForestsDiamondsPricePrediction

This project predicts price of a diamond based on 4C (carat, cut, color and clarity).

We use pandas to convert a csv file into a DataFrame.

In order to use scikit-learn we create a dictionary to convert all diamond features to numbers which programme will use to predict the price. 

We'll use a random forest of 3 decision trees to predict price of specific diamond.
